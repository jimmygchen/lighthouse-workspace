3. **Optional Sections**
   - `## Additional Info` - Edge cases, related issues
   - `## Metrics` - Performance data
   - `## Version` - For bug reports

4. **Code References**
   - Use GitHub permalinks with commit hashes
   - Link to relevant code sections

5. **Writing Style**
   - Natural, concise, direct
   - Avoid AI-sounding language
   - Be honest about uncertainty

6. **Labels** (suggest appropriate ones)
   - Type: bug / enhancement / optimization / code-quality
   - Component: database / HTTP-API / fork-choice / etc.
   - Effort: good first issue / low-hanging-fruit / major-task
